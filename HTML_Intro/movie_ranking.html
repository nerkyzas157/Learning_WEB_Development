<h1>The Best Movies According to Nierka</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    This is my favourite movie. I love the sci-fi idea and how the story wrangles.
</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    Character development and what actors had to go through to film this movie, is just astonishing. Not to mention the
    soundtrack.
</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>
    In my opinion, the best Q. Tarantino movie. Loved the characters, dialogue and cinematics.
