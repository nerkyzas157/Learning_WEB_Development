# Web Development

Welcome to my Web Development with Python Projects repository! This is a personal collection of various Python web development projects that I develop as I learn the language. The projects range from simple web applications to more complex web development tasks, reflecting my progress from a beginner to a more advanced Python programmer.

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring web development.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Habit Tracking](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Web-Development/tree/main/Habit_Tracking)
- **Description:** This project interacts with the Pixela API to track daily beer consumption. It automates the creation of a user account, graph, and pixels representing the amount of beer consumed each day. The script sends HTTP requests to create and manage the graph, including setting the time zone and deleting test data. The results can be viewed on a [web interface provided by Pixela](https://pixe.la//v1/users/nerkyzas157/graphs/beergraph1.html). 
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project highlights skills in API integration, HTTP requests handling using the Requests library in Python, working with JSON data, and automating repetitive tasks. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to manage authentication and authorization using headers, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a web service.
- **TODO:** Create a WEB application for creating new pixels to make it easier for users to log their daily habits without manually sending HTTP requests.

### [Workout Tracker](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/WEB_Development/tree/main/Workout_Tracker)
- **Description:** This project is a workout tracker that utilizes the NutritionIX API and Sheety API to record and update workout details. Users input their body metrics (weight, height, and age) and describe their workout activities. The project uses the NutritionIX Natural Language Processing (NLP) API to analyze the workout descriptions and generate detailed exercise data, including the exercise name, duration, and calories burned. This data is then sent to a Google Sheets document via the Sheety API, creating a log of the user's workouts. Review the Google Sheet by pressing [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YvcwwIKQ2EZ7Vt43v-PUPB7aqRNyIEGp6RbkibKTB1M/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project showcases skills in API integration, including the use of RESTful APIs to interact with external services. It demonstrates proficiency in handling JSON responses, manipulating data, and dynamically updating spreadsheets. The project also highlights the ability to create a user-interactive command-line application, utilizing date and time functions for accurate logging.
