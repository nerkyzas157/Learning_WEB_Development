## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring web development.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Cookie Clicker Bot](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/WEB_Development/tree/main/Cookie_Clicker_Bot)
- **Description:** This project automates interactions with the Cookie Clicker game using the Selenium WebDriver. The automation script continuously clicks the main cookie to accumulate points and periodically purchases upgrades to increase the click rate. Feel free to locally add more stages or remove the timer. You can check final result [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4X-fDjTSdQT6Zcdl159VIpZCxKr2jSnOU3Kwyi00g/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project demonstrates proficiency in web automation using Selenium, including browser control, element interaction, and dynamic data extraction. It showcases skills in creating automation scripts, handling web elements by various selectors (ID, CSS), implementing loops for continuous operation, and conditionally performing actions based on real-time data. Additionally, it highlights effective use of time-based operations to manage periodic checks and updates.

### [Data Entry Automation](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/WEB_Development/tree/main/Data_Entry_Automation)
- **Description:** This project is an automation tool that scrapes real estate listings from Zillow and inputs the data into a Google Form. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content from the Zillow website, extracting addresses, prices, and links for the listed properties. The data is then fed into a Google Form using Selenium to automate the form filling and submission process. This project helps automate the tedious task of manually entering real estate data into a spreadsheet or form for further analysis or record-keeping.
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, data extraction, and web automation. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, handling RESTful requests with the requests library, and Selenium for browser automation and interaction. Additionally, it showcases skills in handling dynamic content and working with XPath to locate and manipulate web elements.
