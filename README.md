## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring web development.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Habit Tracking](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Web-Development/tree/main/Habit_Tracking)
- **Description:** This project interacts with the Pixela API to track daily beer consumption. It automates the creation of a user account, graph, and pixels representing the amount of beer consumed each day. The script sends HTTP requests to create and manage the graph, including setting the time zone and deleting test data. The results can be viewed on a [web interface provided by Pixela](https://pixe.la//v1/users/nerkyzas157/graphs/beergraph1.html). 
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project highlights skills in API integration, HTTP requests handling using the Requests library in Python, working with JSON data, and automating repetitive tasks. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to manage authentication and authorization using headers, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a web service.
- **TODO:** Create a WEB application for creating new pixels to make it easier for users to log their daily habits without manually sending HTTP requests.

- **Skills Highlighted:** These projects emphasize foundational web development skills such as HTML for content structure, CSS for styling and layout, integration of web fonts, responsive design principles, and creating visually appealing web pages. They also illustrate proficiency in using external CSS files, applying classes and IDs for targeted styling, and utilizing Flexbox for layout management.
