## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring web development.

## Highlighted Projects

### [REST API](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/WEB_Development/tree/main/REST_API)
- **Description:** This project is a RESTful API built using Flask and SQLAlchemy to manage a database of cafes. The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the cafe database, allowing users to add new cafes, retrieve information about cafes, update cafe details, and delete cafes. It includes features for random cafe selection, searching cafes by location, and updating cafe prices.
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project demonstrates proficiency in building RESTful APIs with Flask, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) using SQLAlchemy, database management, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), and error handling. It also showcases skills in template rendering with Flask, handling request parameters, and securing endpoints with API keys.

### [Data Entry Automation](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/WEB_Development/tree/main/Data_Entry_Automation)
- **Description:** This project is an automation tool that scrapes real estate listings from Zillow and inputs the data into a Google Form. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content from the Zillow website, extracting addresses, prices, and links for the listed properties. The data is then fed into a Google Form using Selenium to automate the form filling and submission process. This project helps automate the tedious task of manually entering real estate data into a spreadsheet or form for further analysis or record-keeping. You can check final result [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4X-fDjTSdQT6Zcdl159VIpZCxKr2jSnOU3Kwyi00g/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, data extraction, and web automation. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, handling RESTful requests with the requests library, and Selenium for browser automation and interaction. Additionally, it showcases skills in handling dynamic content and working with XPath to locate and manipulate web elements.
