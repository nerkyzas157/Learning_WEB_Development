# Welcome to my Flight Finder application!

This application is designed to find cheap flights. 
It's using Google Sheets as Database and SHeety API as connection method. 
To search for flights, I integrated Amadeus API. 
Lastly, to send the notifications, there are two options: 
1. Twilio API - SMS/WhatsApp notifications.
2. SMTP - Sends notification emails.

## Usage
Currently it is set up in a way that users would have to fill out Google Form for them to be added to the database. Once application is launched it searches for flights and if it finds cheaper than usual prices, notifying emails would be sent to all the users.
Feel free to download and use it as you wish. Just keep in mind that you'll have to set up accounts with the API platforms.
